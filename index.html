                Welcome to the official <strong>SolaceyLabs</strong> page. This page will serve as an explanation of <strong>SolaceyLabs</strong> to the general public. We are currently looking for other open-source programmers (Rust, Go, Typescript/Javascript) to contribute to the project. We are also looking for independent researchers in Decentralization, Web 3.0, and Cryptography. You can view our GitHubs at <a href="https://github.com/SolaceyLabs">SolaceyLabs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Silene0259">silene0259</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="subtitle is-4">If you are looking to contribute and want a fulfilling work environment, please send an email to <b>silene@solaceylabs.com</b>.</p>

                NightshadeDashboard (nshade)
            </h3>
            <p class="subtitle is-5">NightshadeDashboard is a general program that is modular/extendable by design and includes the Nightshade Applications. It interacts with Web 3.0 and Blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Aptos. It includes a list of projects that are actively being developed in Rust. It makes heavy usage of new technology like advances in cryptography, networking, and decentralization. It includes a package manager for managing utilies used by Nightshade. It also includes a browser (GUI) that can be used to interact with Web 3.0 and decentralization technology.</p>

            <h3 class="title is-3">
                SolaceyAccountManager (SAM)
            </h3>
            <p class="subtitle is-5">SolaceyAccountManager is an API system to integrate into online services. It acts as an intermediate to control account information for the general user. It can be looked at as a password manager without the passwords.</p>

                libsumatra-rs
            </h3>
            <p class="subtitle is-5">libsumatra-rs is currently being developed as utilties used for cryptography and Web 3.0. Its cryptography implementation is hosted on my GitHub page located <a href="https://github.com/Silene0259/libsumatracrypt-rs">here</a>.</p>

                Oblivious Data Integrity Verification (ODIV) using Homomorphic Encryption and Hash Functions
            </h3>
            <p class="subtitle is-5">ODIV are powerful tools that can be used to verify two nodes have the same data without revealing what that data is. This can be something as simple as a password, image, public key, or text. The paper is available on my GitHub Page located <a href="https://github.com/Silene0259/ObliviousDataIntegrityVerification-silene">here</a>.</p>

            Decentralized Account Management Login Chain Using VRFs
            </h3>
            <p class="subtitle is-5">Decentralized Systems are powerful. A new method has been discovered that allows verification of accounts using VRFs and Block Lattices. The general description is available <a href="https://github.com/Silene0259/Decentralized-Systems-Basics-silene?tab=readme-ov-file#decentralized-account-management-without-contacting-server-or-requiring-password-0x0000">here</a>.</p>
